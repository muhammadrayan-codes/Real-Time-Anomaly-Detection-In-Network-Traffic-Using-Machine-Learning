# Real-Time-Anomaly-Detection-In-Network-Traffic-Using-Machine-Learning
A real-time anomaly detection system for network traffic using machine learning and a custom Tkinter-based user interface. Trained on the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, it identifies suspicious patterns using selected network features with the help of random forest classifier along with Scapy for live packet sniffing.
